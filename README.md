# Aerosol Radiative Forcing Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting aerosol radiative forcing parameters, specifically TOA (Top of Atmosphere), SUR (Surface), and ATM (Atmosphere), using supervised machine learning techniques. The study leverages the SBDART (Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer) model to generate a comprehensive dataset of aerosol optical properties, and then applies various regression algorithms to predict radiative forcing with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Dataset Generation:**
   - **Parameters:** 
     - **AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth):** Varies from 0.2 to 2.0.
     - **ALPHA (Angstrom Exponent):** Ranges from -0.5 to 2.0.
     - **SSA (Single Scattering Albedo):** Spans 0.5 to 1.0.
     - **ASY (Asymmetry Factor):** Varies from 0.5 to 1.0.
   - **Model:** The SBDART model is utilized to simulate radiative forcing under various aerosol conditions, generating outputs for TOA, SUR, and ATM.

### 2. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - **RandomForestRegressor**
   - **SupportVectorRegressor**
   - **GradientBoostingRegressor**
   - These models are trained on the generated dataset to predict TOA, SUR, and ATM for new aerosol conditions. The models demonstrated impressive accuracy on test datasets, making them powerful tools for radiative forcing prediction.

### 3. **Results:**
   - The machine learning models successfully captured the complex relationships between aerosol optical properties and radiative forcing parameters. The project highlights the potential of data-driven approaches in atmospheric science, particularly in scenarios where computationally expensive simulations are required.
